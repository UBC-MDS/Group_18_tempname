# Team Contract

## Team Members
* Linh Giang Nguyen
* Sam Quist
* Shiv Jena
* Steven Leung
 
## Expectations
* All group members commit to completing all assigned work barring any extraneous circumstances, which will be communicated to the group and accommodated for.
* All submissions are to be done to the best of the individualâ€™s ability to produce a high-quality piece of work. If support is required, we expect that each other will do the utmost to share knowledge to get all group members up to speed.

## Meetings
* We agree to attend all meetings where possible (absences due to unforeseen circumstances or COVID-19 related reasons are acceptable) and contribute ideas and feedback during discussions.
* Three meetings will be held each week with Milestone submissions, one during the lab session (Monday 2-4pm, mandatory), another on Thursdays (mandatory) from 4-4:30pm and the final meeting (if necessary) to be scheduled on Fridays from 4-5pm.
* The main agenda for each meeting:
- Monday (mandatory): Break down the work into tasks and assign to individual team members.  
- Thursday (mandatory): Led by the member responsible for the Milestone submission of the week, review all the tasks (GitHub "issues" on the repo) to make sure that all tasks are done.  Define any outstanding tasks if necessary.
- Friday (if necessary): Review outstanding tasks.
* If a member cannot make to a meeting, they should communicate this via Slack as well as their reasons for being unable to attend at least 24 hours in advance.
 
## Communication
* Our primary communication channels will be Slack and the Github issues page. Github will be primarily used for technical questions, suggestions, submitting and reviewing work. Slack will be used for more informal means such as setting up group meetings and touching base on where pieces of work are at.
 
## Reviews
* All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com by the end of Wednesday. From there, the assigned reviewer (paired up with the creator of the PR) will review (including performing the appropriate testing of code if any) the PR before approving the PR.
 
## Roles
* Each week, a group member will be chosen to be the responsible for the Milestone submission of the week.  It is their responsibility for that work to ensure that all work required to complete the milestone is prepared and accounted for.  All PRs should have already been approved or closed before the team meeting every Thursday.
 
## Deadlines
* Deadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings, with the majority being completed by Wednesday in preparation for the Thursday meeting. These deadlines will be at least 24 hours prior to the submission time to allow for a comprehensive review and discussion if necessary.
 
## Breach of Contract
* Failure to follow the team contract will result in a strike system:
1. The first strike is a verbal warning from the project group outlining the violation.
2. The second strike is a written warning on Slack outlining the violation.
3. The third, and final, strike is a written email to the lecturers and TAs notifying them of all violations to date and potential exclusion from obtaining the group assignment mark.
