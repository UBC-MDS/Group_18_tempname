# Project Proposal

## Motivation and Purpose
Our role: Data scientists/Dog enthusiasts!

Target audience: Prospective dog owners and those who work in the dog business

Picking out your new furry friend can be difficult, especially when you don't know what kind you want! With our doggodash project, we aim to assist those in making a decision as to what kind of dog fits their preferences best and give insight to what kind of breeds are the highest rated in certain fields. Our visualization and recommendation tools will make this process simple by allowing the user to filter for specific dog traits and even use our selection algorithm to see which dog fits them the best.
